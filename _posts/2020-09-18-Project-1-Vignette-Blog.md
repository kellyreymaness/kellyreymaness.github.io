# Project 1 Vignette
---

The vignette created for Project 1 walks through various steps on how to access, manipulate and analyze NHL Records and Stats data. Specifically, the steps include: 
*Reading in data via an API
*Writing functions to automate the process of utlizing APIs for data
*Manipulating and reshaping data by adding new variables and joining two datasets, respectively
*Analyzing data through summarization and visualization

I spent quite a bit of time on this project -- more than the predicted max range and still feel that I could've spent additional time perfecting my code. If I could re-start this project, I would've gotten started sooner and would have leaned more on my classmates and instructors. Though touching base a couple of times, there's certainly much more insight I could've gleaned from them. Because of the technical nature of coding, I tend to spend more time independently trying to identify & correct issues than connecting with others as its more a function of the technical nature of coding than lack of understanding, and I feel that I learn best when uncovering these issues through critical assessment. That said, I struggled mightily setting up the functions specifically for the Stats API and the wrapper function and did myself a diservice by defaulting to this method of work.  

For future projects, my biggest takeaway is to start as early as possible and connect often with my peers and instructors.
