Hey! My name is **Kelly Baker**. I'm a North Carolina native living in Raleigh, NC. Currently, I work full-time in research in the economic development industry and am a part-time graduate student at NC State University in the Data Management & Applied Statistics certification program. 

# More Information

I'm married and my husband and I have two dogs -- a Pitbull mix and a German Shepherd. We enjoy traveling, or so we did in pre-COVID times! A few years ago we did a cross-country road trip visiting 11 national parks along the way. I also enjoy exercising, learning new things, spending time with friends & family, and completing home improvement/DIY projects.
